# EquatePlus SE Edition plugin for MoneyMoney

A quick and dirty plugin for MoneyMoney for share depot - specifically for Equate Plus SE depots. Now with the functionality to retrieve corporate share plans of your employer.
This is a pure personal and private project and has absolutely no relationship to any company - but might be usefull for SE employees.

It may work or not work for other depots.

Released version is ncurrently not signed and will only run in beta versions of the MoneyMoney App.


## ToDos

* Union the inital fork and the SE Edition to have one version of the EquatePlus extension
* Patches, Updates etc. may not be signed immediately  - you need to use Beta Version of MoneyMoney and currently allow unsigned extensions


## Credits 

Forked from neatc0der, who forked from Michael-Beutling as my specific corporate shares depot requires different mapping which I added to my fork.
Main credits to go to Michael-Beutling and the others in the fork chain, as I only added functionality for corporate share plans.
